# Escape From the Pit

This is a simple little game demo done in Python and Pygame.  There's only one
level and the mechanics are basic, but what you see is what you get.

### Requirements

Python 2.7 and the latest version of Pygame.

### Notes
* The collision detection between the player and the platforms is a bit janky.
* The objective is to just survive as long as you can, so it's a bit boring.
* Have fun.
